Sarah: Hey Mike, did you catch the baseball game last night?

Mike: Yeah, I did! That was one intense match. Did you see those hot dogs they were serving at the stadium?

Sarah: Oh, you bet I did! Those hot dogs were massive. I couldn't resist getting one. How about you?

Mike: Same here! It's like a tradition for me to grab a hot dog when I'm at the game. And the extra toppings they had were incredible. Mustard, onions, and jalapeños – I loaded mine up.

Sarah: Haha, I went for the classic ketchup and relish combo. But back to the game, what a nail-biter, right? That last-minute home run by Johnson really sealed the deal.

Mike: Absolutely! The crowd went wild. It's moments like that which make being at the stadium so special. The energy is unmatched.

Sarah: Totally agree, Mike. Can't wait for the next game. Hopefully, there will be more hot dogs and exciting plays!

Mike: You said it, Sarah. Let's plan to catch the next one together. Hot dogs and baseball – a perfect combo!
